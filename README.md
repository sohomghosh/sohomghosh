### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a passionate Data Detective with hands-on experience in solving business problems. 
I have been working on Data Sciences across different industries like Financial Services, Internet and so on.
In addition to being the co-author of the book NLP Fundamentals, I have several publications in proceedings of international conferences and refereed journals.
I am a Computer Science Engineer and I hold a Master's Degree in Software Systems (with specialization in Data Analytics) from BITS Pilani, India.
In one sentence, "I am a Data Scientist by profession, an Engineer by qualification and an Artist from within". ðŸ˜„
I love reading, trekking and playing harmonica.
I am a fitness buff and I believe that "Health is Wealth".
